# Global Curriculum

Our curriculum contains objectives, prerequisites, suggested materials, starter and solution code, and other instructional resources. See below for a complete description of the curriculum. Anyone is welcome to submit new lessons or suggest changes to existing ones.

> Instructors should review the [curriculum onboarding deck](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/presentation/d/1ob51BnjcOhpZ6MHTfmwj0Lb0O_8cDtbTsOpcKw4Ikak/edit?usp=sharing), then review the materials linked below. These cover resources like our [schedule planning walkthrough](../resources/guidelines/schedule-planning.md) and [student feedback guide](./03-projects/project-feedback.md).

## 01. [New Instructor Onboarding](./01-instructor-onboarding/)

We provide numerous resources for new instructors in our [Instructor Onboarding folder](./01-instructor-onboarding), including:

- [DSI Curriculum Overview](https://docs.google.com/a/generalassemb.ly/presentation/d/1ob51BnjcOhpZ6MHTfmwj0Lb0O_8cDtbTsOpcKw4Ikak/edit?usp=sharing)

## 02. [New Student Onboarding](./02-student-onboarding/)

Before students ever step foot in the classroom, we ask them to complete up to [40 hours of preparatory exercises](./02-student-onboarding/readme.md). After students enroll in the course, they are sent the following required modules:

- Python Syntax Overview
- Statistics Fundamentals Refresher
- Git Concept Overview
- Command Line Syntax
- SQL Syntax Overview

#### Onboarding Assessment

Once students complete the required pre-course modules, they are asked to submit a final preparatory assessment. This will help you better gauge their entry-level familiarity with core course concepts.

> Note: Ask your producer for access to student answer submissions. 

- [DSI: Student Onboarding Assessment](https://mobilega.typeform.com/to/SOC7S7)

#### Installfest

Prior to Day 1, we also provide materials to help students get their machines ready for class. This "Installfest" lesson reviews the technology required and walks through installation, configuration, and testing of common applications and libraries.

We **strongly recommend** that you require students to complete an "Installfest" session prior to the first day of class.

> Note: Work with your local production team to schedule "Installfest" for your market.

## 03. [Data Science Projects](./03-projects/)

Our Data Science Immersive includes seven weekly projects and one final "Capstone" project, subdivided into five deliverables. Each project builds on top of previously learned skills to scaffold student performance over the entire course.

Projects include detailed objectives, requirements, and starter code, along with rubrics and solution code for student assessment. Each weekly project ties into the overall competencies developed during that week, while the capstone project requires students to apply and synthesize the skills developed within each unit.

#### [Weekly Projects](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly)

Weekly projects develop detailed scenarios for students, providing a context in which to apply the data science workflow to a specific dataset.

- [Project 1: SAT Scores + Summary Statistics](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-01)
- [Project 2: Billboard Hits + Data Munging](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-02)
- [Project 3: Liquor Sales + Linear Regression](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-03)
- [Project 4: Web Scraping + Logistic Regression](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-04)
- [Project 5: Disaster Reflief + Classification](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-05)
- [Project 6: IMDB API + Random Forests](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-06)
- [Project 7: Airport Delays + Cluster Analysis](./03-projects/01-projects-weekly/project-07)


#### [Capstone Projects](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone)

The Capstone project requires students to apply the data science workflow to their choice of dataset, in order to create detailed recommendations for an audience representative of their chosen industry. This project is sub-divided into five parts:

- [Part 1: Capstone Topic + Dataset Validation](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-01)
- [Part 2: Problem Statement + Exploratory Data Analysis](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-02)
- [Part 3: Progress Report + Preliminary Findings](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-03)
- [Part 4: Report Writeup + Technical Analysis](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-04)
- [Part 5: Presentation + Recommendations](./03-projects/02-projects-capstone/part-05)

## 04. [Data Science Weekly Curriculum](./04-lessons/)

General Assembly's Data Science Immersive is made up of 4 Units split into 3 weeks each. These are:

#### [Unit Breakdown](./04-lessons)

> Note: Flex sessions can be used for content review or additional topics that instructors may want to cover.

**Holiday Scheduling**: Every immersive course typically has one-two national holidays that fall within the course timeline; typically these are made up by adding on course days afterward. Instructors should check with their producers for specific information.
